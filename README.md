# üåå SZ Effect and Galaxy Cluster Analysis

Welcome to the **SZ Effect and Galaxy Cluster Analysis** repository! This project focuses on the simulation, detection, and analysis of the Sunyaev-Zel‚Äôdovich (SZ) effect in galaxy clusters using advanced machine learning techniques. The project includes multiple approaches, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) and Random Forest classifiers, to estimate the mass fraction of gas in galaxy clusters.

## üîç Overview

The main objectives of this project are:

- **SZ Effect Simulation**: Simulate the SZ effect in galaxy clusters and study its implications for cosmology.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Develop machine learning models to estimate gas mass fractions in galaxy clusters using SZ effect data.
- **Random Forest Classification**: Classify galaxy clusters based on the presence of the SZ effect using a Random Forest classifier.
- **Mass Estimation**: Use Ridge Regression and other techniques to improve the accuracy of galaxy cluster mass estimations.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

- **`Random_forest_sz.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook implementing a Random Forest classifier to detect SZ effects in galaxy clusters.
- **`CNN_sz_detection.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook for using a CNN to detect the SZ effect in galaxy clusters.
- **`galaxy_cluster_mass_estimation_sz.ipynb`**: Notebook for estimating the mass of galaxy clusters using SZ data and regression models.
